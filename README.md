# Readme

The server and client files being used here are modified versions of the Pion examples repository directory called sfu-ws: https://github.com/pion/example-webrtc-applications/tree/master/sfu-ws 

At present this repo isn't what the description says it is -- It has essentially just been forked from 'miniConf'. 
This *will* support rooms (first step) and be pared down from audio/video to audio only (second step) and finally, integrated into Umbra.
