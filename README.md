# Readme

The server and client files being used here are modified versions of the Pion examples repository directory called sfu-ws: https://github.com/pion/example-webrtc-applications/tree/master/sfu-ws 

Todos:

- Support rooms (done?-ish?)

- Check to see if renegotiations trigger skipping/disruption between already active participants

- Refactor to not have everyone connected to everyone
